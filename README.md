# Lore Spoilers

Hide lorebook entries from yourself while the AI still sees everything. Perfect for generating spoiler-heavy content without spoiling yourself.

## What It Does

Click one button to automatically:
1. Blur all content so you can't read it
2. Expand all entries in the lorebook
3. Replace everything with ciphered text (ROT13)
4. Remove the blur

**You never see the plaintext. The AI always does.**

## Installation

1. Open SillyTavern
2. **Extensions → Install Extension**
3. Paste repo URL: `https://github.com/your-username/lore-spoilers`
4. Click **Install** and refresh

## Usage

1. Enable "Lore Spoilers" in Extensions settings
2. Open a lorebook in World Info
3. Click **"🔒 Expand & Cipher All"**
4. Done! Click **"👁️ Reveal All"** to undo

## Use Cases

- Generate 50 plot twists without reading them
- Hide secret character backgrounds in RPG campaigns
- Keep story branches hidden until discovered
- Store spoiler-heavy worldbuilding lore

## How It Works

- **You see**: Ciphered gibberish (ROT13)
- **AI sees**: Original plaintext
- **Database stores**: Original plaintext (never ciphered)

The blur filter ensures you never accidentally see content during the expansion process.

## Requirements

SillyTavern 1.12.0 or higher

## Notes

- Handles up to 1000 entries per lorebook automatically
- Plaintext is always preserved when saving
- Works with any lorebook
